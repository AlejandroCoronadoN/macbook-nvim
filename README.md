## About The Project

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Start by installing homebrew in you computer

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After this you will be able to install neovim

```sh
brew install neovim
```

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm

  ```sh

  git clone https://github.com/AlejandroCoronadoN/macbook-nvim.git /tmp/macbook-nvim && mkdir -p ~/.config && cp -r /tmp/macbook-nvim/nvim ~/.config/nvim && rm -rf /tmp/macbook-nvim
  ```
