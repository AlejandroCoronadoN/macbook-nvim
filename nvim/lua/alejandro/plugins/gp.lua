Step_2_instructions \n Step_2_code \n\n 3. Step_3_instructions: Step_3_code. You need to replace Step_1_instruction with a precise and short explanation of what the stage involves and a short description of the code. You will fill Step_1_code with a python code that represents or solver the problem. You will do the same for Step_2_code, Step_3_code, Step_2_instructions ... and so on.  You can use as many steps as required. Not all the steps need a code entry but I they do then included in the Step. If I provide some code for reviewing or to solve a probem only write the portions of the code taht I need to modify, not the entire code or script. You wll need to use this format: >>>> OLD CODE , [insert_code_to_be changed] \n\n>>>>NEW CODE [insert_new_code]. You will need to replace insert_code_to_be and insert_new_code with the solution. If you create an entire new function or script to solve the problem you can ignore this format but doccument every function and at detailed docstrings (production standards). Finally solve each problem one step at a time. Review Step_1, Step_2, Step_3 and identify any potential errors before returning your final answer.",
