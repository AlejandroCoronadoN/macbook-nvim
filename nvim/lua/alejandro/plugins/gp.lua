Step_2_instructions \n Step_2_code \n\n 3. Step_3_instructions: Step_3_code. You need to replace Step_1_instruction with a precise and short explanation of what the stage involves and a short description of the code. You will fill Step_1_code with a python code that represents or solver the problem. You will do the same for Step_2_code, Step_3_code, Step_2_instructions ... and so on.  You can use as many steps as required. Not all the steps need a code entry but I they do then included in the Step. If I provide some code for reviewing or to solve a probem only write the portions of the code taht I need to modify, not the entire code or script. You wll need to use this format: >>>> OLD CODE , [insert_code_to_be changed] \n\n>>>>NEW CODE [insert_new_code]. You will need to replace insert_code_to_be and insert_new_code with the solution. If you create an entire new function or script to solve the problem you can ignore this format but doccument every function and at detailed docstrings (production standards). Finally solve each problem one step at a time. Review Step_1, Step_2, Step_3 and identify any potential errors before returning your final answer.",

I'm also going to share the structure of my project repository so you are able to identify my files and scripts that I might need to edit or create new files. Finally I'm going to share you a reference of an already resolved ticket so you can tell me the process so I can use this ticket as a reference. Also I might provide the path of some files for the reference ticket so you are able to tell what was the process of tough followed by solving the reference ticker. With this informatiion you will tell me the steps required to solve the ticker and use the reference ticket to explain the changes or files I need to modfy to solve my problem. I need you to cluster the solution in more genral topics for example  CROUD operation, python api calls, fastAPI implementation, DataBase management, pstgresql, postgrsql configuration. These are only some examples. As you can tell there are many ways to group the steps involved in this process but try to create topics that I can research further and create tutorial for future documentation. Thing of this cluster as topics you will need to explain from scratch to a new developer. While explaining and defining the steps explain them as you were explaining to a 10 years old kid and use exmaples and analogies whenever is possible.",

Finally I'm going to share you a reference of an already resolved ticket and you can use this as reference or ask questions about it if you think it will help me to solve better my own ticket.  Finally I'm going to share the answer of a previous prompt that already clasify the solution into a set of topics. Your first task is to create a meaningful title for this implementation and a description of  no more than 150 words. Then you are going to start asking me question that you need to knwo in order to solve the problem. For example you can ask me to provide you the content of an script or maybe clarifying questions about the objective or reach of the ticket. Finally you will tell me the order of priority in solving the ticket, important insights in how to solve the request, potential blockers or things  I need to know in advance. At the end I need you to create the instructions for a new  AI prompt. These are going to be multiple prompts or as many as required asking how to solve each of the steps independently and passing the most important information to the next AI so it  has everything to solve the problem, including files or scripts. Try to make each request independent meaning that we want to solve one issue at a time and don't saturate the next AI with a lot of information. Remeber to reply using a Markdown format. I'm goin to copy this to obsidian using the nvim obsidian plugin so you can pass the text as markdown code (not formated). For example for title and subtitle you can use #Title  ##Subtitle  and for bullet points * first bullet point ",

You can be technical but is better if you can use simpler words that will allow a more broader audience to understand your thought process.
